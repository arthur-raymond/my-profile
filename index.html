<h1>Hello, I'm Arthur</h1>
<img src="images/profile.jpg"> 
<p>I love skiing, climbing and cooking. I launched my website to share my passion of cooking with recipes for students and it is called Cookieseg !</p>

<h2>Skiing</h2>
<p>
I am passionate about skiing, in fact what I love the most about it is the freedom it gives you, the tremoundous sensation of speed and indeed the landscape. For me mountains are the simplest but also the most oustanding creations of our planet.	
</p>
<h2>Climbing</h2>
<p>
I started climbing back when I entered IÃ©seg school of management, which is quite late. But when i use the word 'passion' I really donot put those words lightly, in fact I go to the climbing gym tow to three times !	What i really like about this sport is the aestethic side of it and the fact that you always need to push your limits further to climb another new problem.
</p>
<h2>Cooking</h2>
<p>
I really enjoy cooking since I am twelve. My mom teached me how to cook and I canot stop preparing meals to anybody at anytime eversince. I really like to show my skills to others and when my friends eat my food i have the feeling that i transmit a part of my passion and it makes me always satisfied. And this is exactly the reason why I had to open a site to share even more my knowledge to my comrades'school.
